# Getting Started with Deep Learning in PyTorch

PyTorch is one of the most popular deep learning frameworks, known for its flexibility and intuitive design. This tutorial will guide you through the basics of building and training neural networks with PyTorch.

## Prerequisites

Before we begin, make sure you have the following installed:

```python
import torch
import torch.nn as nn
import torch.optim as optim
import torchvision
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
import numpy as np
```

## Building a Simple Neural Network

Let's create a basic neural network for image classification:

```python
class SimpleNN(nn.Module):
    def __init__(self):
        super(SimpleNN, self).__init__()
        self.flatten = nn.Flatten()
        self.linear_relu_stack = nn.Sequential(
            nn.Linear(28*28, 512),
            nn.ReLU(),
            nn.Linear(512, 512),
            nn.ReLU(),
            nn.Linear(512, 10)
        )

    def forward(self, x):
        x = self.flatten(x)
        logits = self.linear_relu_stack(x)
        return logits

# Initialize the model
model = SimpleNN()
print(model)
```

## Loading Data

PyTorch provides convenient data loaders for common datasets:

```python
# Load MNIST dataset
transform = torchvision.transforms.Compose([
    torchvision.transforms.ToTensor(),
    torchvision.transforms.Normalize((0.1307,), (0.3081,))
])

train_dataset = torchvision.datasets.MNIST(
    root='./data', 
    train=True, 
    download=True, 
    transform=transform
)

test_dataset = torchvision.datasets.MNIST(
    root='./data', 
    train=False, 
    download=True, 
    transform=transform
)

train_loader = torch.utils.data.DataLoader(train_dataset, batch_size=64, shuffle=True)
test_loader = torch.utils.data.DataLoader(test_dataset, batch_size=1000)
```

## Training the Model

Now, let's train our neural network:

```python
def train(model, train_loader, epochs=5):
    # Loss function and optimizer
    loss_fn = nn.CrossEntropyLoss()
    optimizer = optim.SGD(model.parameters(), lr=0.01)
    
    # Training loop
    for epoch in range(epochs):
        running_loss = 0.0
        for batch_idx, (data, target) in enumerate(train_loader):
            # Zero the parameter gradients
            optimizer.zero_grad()
            
            # Forward pass
            outputs = model(data)
            
            # Calculate loss
            loss = loss_fn(outputs, target)
            
            # Backward pass and optimize
            loss.backward()
            optimizer.step()
            
            # Print statistics
            running_loss += loss.item()
            if batch_idx % 100 == 99:
                print(f'Epoch {epoch+1}, Batch {batch_idx+1}: Loss {running_loss/100:.3f}')
                running_loss = 0.0
    
    print('Training complete!')

# Train the model
train(model, train_loader)
```

## Visualizing Results

Let's visualize some predictions:

```python
def visualize_predictions(model, test_loader):
    # Get a batch of test data
    dataiter = iter(test_loader)
    images, labels = next(dataiter)
    
    # Make predictions
    with torch.no_grad():
        outputs = model(images)
        _, predicted = torch.max(outputs, 1)
    
    # Plot results
    plt.figure(figsize=(12, 6))
    for i in range(10):
        plt.subplot(2, 5, i+1)
        plt.imshow(images[i][0], cmap='gray')
        plt.title(f'Pred: {predicted[i]}, True: {labels[i]}')
        plt.axis('off')
    plt.tight_layout()
    plt.show()

# Visualize predictions
visualize_predictions(model, test_loader)
```

## Saving and Loading the Model

Finally, let's save our trained model:

```python
# Save the model
torch.save(model.state_dict(), 'mnist_model.pth')

# Load the model
loaded_model = SimpleNN()
loaded_model.load_state_dict(torch.load('mnist_model.pth'))
loaded_model.eval()  # Set to evaluation mode
```

## Conclusion

In this tutorial, we've covered the basics of building, training, and using neural networks with PyTorch. This is just the beginning â€“ PyTorch offers many more advanced features for building sophisticated deep learning models.

In future tutorials, we'll explore more complex architectures like CNNs and RNNs, as well as techniques for transfer learning and fine-tuning.

# Sentiment Analysis with LSTM Networks

This project demonstrates how to implement a Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) neural network for sentiment analysis of movie reviews.

## Project Overview

Sentiment analysis is the task of determining whether a piece of text expresses positive, negative, or neutral sentiment. In this project, I used the IMDB movie reviews dataset to train an LSTM model that can classify reviews as positive or negative.

## Technologies Used

- Python 3.8
- TensorFlow 2.6
- Keras
- NumPy
- Pandas
- Matplotlib

## Implementation Details

The model architecture consists of:
- An embedding layer to convert words to vectors
- An LSTM layer with 128 units
- A dropout layer for regularization
- A dense output layer with sigmoid activation

The implementation achieved 87.5% accuracy on the test set, demonstrating the effectiveness of LSTM networks for text classification tasks.

## Code Repository

The complete code is available on [GitHub](https://github.com/yourusername/sentiment-analysis-lstm).

## Results and Visualization

[Include visualizations of the training process, confusion matrix, or sample predictions]

## Future Improvements

Potential enhancements to this project include:
- Using bidirectional LSTM for better context understanding
- Implementing attention mechanisms
- Incorporating pre-trained word embeddings like GloVe or Word2Vec
- Exploring transfer learning with models like BERT or RoBERTa
```

3. Create the directory for your project images:
```
mkdir -p images/projects
```

4. Add your header and teaser images to the directory

## Changing Profile Picture and Banner

### Profile Picture

1. Prepare your new profile picture
2. Replace `/images/bio-pic-2.jpg` with your new image
3. Alternatively, add a new image and update the reference in `_config.yml`:

```yaml
author:
  name             : "Rakib Al Fahad"
  avatar           : "/images/your-new-profile-pic.jpg"
```

### Banner Images

1. Prepare your new banner images
2. For the homepage banner, replace `/images/waterfront.jpg` or update `index.html`:

```yaml
header:
  image: "/images/your-new-banner.jpg"
```

3. For page-specific banners, update the front matter in each page file.

## Remember

- Always commit and push your changes to GitHub to publish your updates
- Optimize images for web to ensure fast loading times
- Test your changes locally before pushing to GitHub
