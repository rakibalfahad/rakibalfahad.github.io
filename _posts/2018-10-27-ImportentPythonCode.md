# Description
In this page I will try to give you some helpful python code blocks that we need
to use for data preprocessing, machine learning and data visualization. I have
collected them over the time from different sources and help files.

**If lots of error/warning shows in jupyter notebook. you can stop showing
warning massages**

```python
import warnings
warnings.filterwarnings('ignore')
```
