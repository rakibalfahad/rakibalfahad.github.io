#### I started working at CVPIA lab from Fall 2013. I am pursuing my Ph.D. in Computer Engineering at the Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering at The University of Memphis. My research interest includes the following areas with the focus on cognitive neuroscience:


- Exploratory data analysis, visualization and pattern analysis.
- Feature selection in higher dimensional data with a limited sample size.
- Classical machine learning, clustering, and regression analysis.
- Connectivity analysis, visualization and graph mining.
- Bayesian nonparametric methods for clustering and time series analysis.
- Recurrent neural network analysis for time series prediction, classification, and forecasting.
- Convolutional neural network, transfer learning, and generative adversarial networks.
- Representations and visualization of visual concepts learned by convnets.
- Big data analysis in a distributed computing system using Scala and Apache Spark.


Currently, I am working on the following projects:

# Project: Modeling of Cognitive Performance

Early Imaging-Based Predictive Modeling of Cognitive Performance Following Therapy for Childhood ALL": a collaboration project with St. Jude Children's Research Hospital, Memphis, TN led by Dr. Mohammed Yeasin and Dr. Wilburn Reddick.

Project: Human Connectome Project

Find out individual difference form human brain connectivity using deep learning and graph mining approach led by Dr. Mohammed Yeasin and Dr. Abbas Babajani-Feremi.

# Project: Epistemic state of mind and color of emotion

Modeling epistemic state of mind and color of emotion from the electroencephalogram (EEG) physiological data. This research is an integral part of the ongoing blind ambition project led by Dr. Mohammed Yeasin.
