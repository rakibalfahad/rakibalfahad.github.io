# About Me

I'm Rakib Al Fahad, a data scientist and machine learning expert with a passion for solving complex problems using cutting-edge techniques. I completed my Ph.D. in Computer Engineering at the University of Memphis, where I conducted research at the [CVPIA](http://cvpia.memphis.edu/) lab.

## Expertise

My expertise spans across multiple disciplines within data science and machine learning:

- **Data Analysis and Visualization**: Proficient in exploratory data analysis, data visualization, and pattern analysis.
- **Machine Learning**: Experienced in classical machine learning algorithms, clustering, and regression analysis.
- **Deep Learning**: Skilled in neural networks, including CNNs, RNNs, and advanced architectures.
- **Time Series Analysis**: Specialized in time series prediction, classification, and forecasting using recurrent neural networks.
- **Big Data Analytics**: Experienced in distributed computing systems using Scala and Apache Spark.

## Research Interests

My research interests include:

- Feature selection in higher dimensional data with limited sample size
- Connectivity analysis, visualization, and graph mining
- Bayesian nonparametric methods for clustering and time series analysis
- Representations and visualization of visual concepts learned by convnets
- Transfer learning and generative adversarial networks

## Technical Skills

- **Programming Languages**: Python, R, Scala, JavaScript
- **Libraries & Frameworks**: TensorFlow, PyTorch, Scikit-learn, Pandas, NumPy
- **Data Visualization**: Matplotlib, Seaborn, Plotly, D3.js
- **Big Data Tools**: Apache Spark, Hadoop
- **Database Systems**: SQL, MongoDB, Neo4j
- **Cloud Platforms**: AWS, Google Cloud Platform, Azure

## Notable Projects

### Neural Dynamics Underlying Auditory Categorization
This project focused on understanding the neurobiology of normal perception of speech, music and auditory learning, with implications for interventions for communication problems that impair sound categorization. (Collaboration with PI: Gavin M. Bidelman, Co-I: M. Yeasin, UofM ECE - NIH-NIDCD R01)

### Predictive Modeling of Cognitive Performance
Early Imaging-Based Predictive Modeling of Cognitive Performance Following Therapy for Childhood ALL: a collaboration project with St. Jude Children's Research Hospital, Memphis, TN led by Dr. Mohammed Yeasin and Dr. Wilburn Reddick.

### Human Connectome Project
Research on individual differences in human brain connectivity using deep learning and graph mining approaches, led by Dr. Mohammed Yeasin and Dr. Abbas Babajani-Feremi.

### Epistemic State of Mind and Color of Emotion
Modeling epistemic state of mind and color of emotion from electroencephalogram (EEG) physiological data, as part of the blind ambition project led by Dr. Mohammed Yeasin.
